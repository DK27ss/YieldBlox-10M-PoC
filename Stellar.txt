🚨 YieldBlox.finance has been exploited for $10 million on Stellar blockchain

Attacker manipulated the SDEX price of USTRY (Etherfuse US Treasury stablebond) to inflate its valuation on the Reflector oracle. The USTRY/XLM order book had <5 USTRY depth on the ask side, making manipulation trivial. At 00:25 UTC, the Reflector oracle misreported a significantly inflated USTRY price. The attacker used the inflated collateral valuation to borrow ~61M XLM + ~1M USDC from the community-ran YieldBlox DAO Pool on Blend V2.

Impact:
- 61,249,278 XLM + 1,000,196 USDC borrowed from pool
- 901K USDC bridged out to Ethereum mainnet
- 16M XLM distributed to 5+ secondary wallets
- 48M XLM frozen
